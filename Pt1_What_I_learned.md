# What I learned :brain:

While most of the specifics about how to use Git/Github (such as pull requests, pushing and committing changes, creating repositories) was a bit of a refresher
for me, I feel like I did learn quite a bit of useful new things. For example, I learned more about the syntax for creating markdown files (like a readme; eg. bullets,
numbered lists, and checkboxes -- see below). I also learned about GitHub Explore and following other users / starring interesting repositories. I feel like this could
be very useful!

## Numbered Lists
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

## Checkboxes (neat!)
- [X] This item is complete
- [ ] This item still needs to be done
